         "How ONS statistics fit into the UK economy is an adaptation of the 4-sector circular flow of income diagram. The diagram shows the flow of money to and from the four main actors within the economy. The flow of goods or services usually operates in the opposite direction."
       , "The household unit plays a key role within the economy, through its connections to other actors. The census in 2011 surveyed the 23.4 million households in England and Wales. Households are the main providers of the factors of production that the firm demands to produce goods and services. The factors of production are Labour, Capital, Land, and Entrepreneurship."
       , "In greater detail - the household is a labour source – so therefore receives wages or salaries. The ONS produces the latest figures for the Labour market including number of people working (employment) and wage inflation. An estimation of the size of the wage bill for the UK is the compensation of employees figure in the Second estimate of GDP.^^Households also provide capital and entrepreneurship which are rewarded by interest, profit or dividends. The ONS produces figures that show the level of profit in UK companies, these can be found in the expenditure tables of the Second estimate of GDP; however this is not an accurate reflection of how much UK households receive.  Finally, the household can provide land to firms and receive rent. "
       , "Income received from firms is not the only source of income in the four sector model. Households also receive income from social transfers. A social transfer is a payment made by the government to the household and includes Job seekers allowance, sickness benefit, state pension, and tax credits. Estimates of the size of these payments can be found in the Public Sector Finances release"
       , "With the received income, households will pay taxes to the government; this is shown as a transfer of income to the government. The money that is left is referred to as disposable income. Estimates of the size of the payments to government can be found in the Public Sector Finances release, statistics on disposable income can be found in the ONS Household accounts release."
       , "Households can use this disposable income to purchase goods and services produced in the UK (HHFCE) and imports from the rest of the world. The size of imports can be found in ONS UK trade bulletin. The remaining household income is saved and is a withdrawal from the diagram. "
       , "There are roughly 2.15 million enterprises currently operating in the UK according to the latest ONS estimates. Their output can be split into broad sectors, Services (77%), Production (15.6%), Construction (6.8%) and Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (0.6%). The ONS produces monthly output statistics for the three largest sectors. "
       , "Firm’s income in this diagram comes from three sources. The largest source is purchase of goods and services by households. Firms also receive income from foreigners purchasing exports from the UK.  The value of the exports sold to foreigners can be found in the ONS Trade bulletin. "
       , "The final source of income for the firm shown in this diagram is from the government. Governments spend money on goods and services produced by firms. Examples of such are spending on roads, education and health. Therefore there is a flow of money from the government to the firm. Additionally some firms receive subsidies and tax rebates from the government.^^Estimates of the size of these payments can be found in the Second Estimate of GDP. "
       , "All firms are required by law to pay tax and therefore the government receives income from firms. The largest transfer that firms pay is corporation tax, however there are other transfers to the government such as National insurance. Estimates of the size of these payments can be found in the Public Sector Finances release."
       , "Firms require inputs in order to produce goods and services. The firm compensates the household for the inputs that it provides. The household is a labour source – so therefore receives wages or salaries. It also provides capital and entrepreneurship which is rewarded by interest, profit or dividends.^^Finally it can provide land from which it receives rent in return. However, firms do not receive all their inputs from domestic sources – therefore there are additional flows into the firms from outside of the diagram. "
