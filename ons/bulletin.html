        As part of the massive output of data from the Office for National Statistics, they produce monthly statistical bulletins. One short research project was to look at turning the bulletin into an ebook. Conversion to an ebook format was straight-forward and achieved using Sigil. The existing structure of the page was already sound and readily lent itself to CSS changes to improve the visual appeal and make it more readable. The key aims were to provide a visual hierarchy to the page, bring out the main sections and improve the presentation of the tables and graphs.

                        <h2 id="">A brief description of Consumer Price Inflation</h2>

                        <p>Consumer price inflation is the speed at which the prices of the goods and services bought by households rise or fall. Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. One way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. ONS consumer price indices are published monthly.</p>

                        <p>A price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to April 2013, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between April 2012 and April 2013.</p>

                        <p>ONS publishes a range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation. <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/december-2012/sty-a-tale-of-many-price-indices.html">A tale of many price indices</a> summarises information on the different measures.</p>

                        <h3 class="">What is the CPI?</h3>

                        <p>The CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government's target for inflation.</p>

                        <p>The CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information on the uses of the CPI see <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/july-2011/how-ons-consumer-price-statistics-are-used.pdf">How ONS consumer price statistics are used</a>.</p>

                        <h3 class=""><strong>Latest Figure and Long-Term Trend</strong></h3>

                        <p>The CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between April 2012 and April 2013 stood at 2.4%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost Â£100.00 in April 2012 would have cost Â£102.40 in April 2013.</p>

                        <p>This is the first time the 12-month rate has fallen since the increase in tuition fees contributed to the growth in the CPI rising to 2.7% in October 2012. The intervening six months have seen inflation remain relatively stable.</p>

                        <p>Taking a longer term view, the three main contributors to the 12-month inflation rate in the last five years have been food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages, housing costs (including gas and electricity charges) and transport costs (including motor fuels). Combined, these three sectors have, on average, accounted for over half of the 12-month inflation rate each month.</p>

                        <p>Figure A below shows the CPI 12-month rate over the last ten years. Table A below shows the CPI 1-month (the amount prices change between two consecutive months) and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

                          <h2 id="">Consumer Prices Index (CPI): What are the main movements?</h2>

                          <p>This section explains which goods and services had the biggest impact on the change to the 12-month rate between March and April 2013 and (where relevant) considers the longer-term inflationary trends for these goods and services.</p>

                          <p>The change in the CPI 12-month rate can be calculated by comparing the 12-month rates for two consecutive months. An alternative, and equally valid approach, is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest two months and the price change between the same two months a year ago. <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/explaining-the-contributions-to-change-in-12-month-rate.pdf">Explaining the contributions to change in twelve month rate</a> is a diagrammatic explanation of the calculation.</p>

                          <p>The CPI rose by 0.2% between March and April 2013, compared with a larger rise of 0.6% between the same two months in 2012. The smaller 1-month movement this year led to the CPI 12-month rate falling from 2.8% in the year ending March to 2.4% in April.</p>

                          <p>Figure B below shows the contributions from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services. A larger version of the chart can be viewed by clicking on it (HTML version only).<br /></p>

                          <p>By far the largest downward contribution to the change, accounting for almost three quarters of the fall in the growth rate in the CPI 12-month rate between March and April 2013, came from <strong>transport</strong> price movements where overall, prices fell by 0.6% between March and April 2013 compared with a rise of 1.2% between the same two months a year ago. This contributed approximately 0.3 percentage points to the fall in the CPI 12-month rate. The majority of the contribution came from motor fuels and air fares. Petrol and diesel prices both fell, overall, between March and April this year (by 2.1p and 3.9p a litre respectively) compared with rises of 3.2p and 2.1p a year earlier. The price (in pounds sterling) of a barrel of brent crude fell by 6.8% between March and April 2013. Prices, overall, for air fares fell by 6.4% between March and April 2013, compared with a rise of 7.4% between the same two months a year ago.</p>

                          <p>There were comparatively modest downward contributions from most other sectors, notably from price movements for restaurants &amp; hotels, recreation &amp; culture goods and services and housing costs (including energy costs).</p>

                          <p>The only notable upward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between March and April 2013, came from <strong>food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages</strong> price movements where overall, prices rose by 0.7% between March and April compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same two months in 2012. The upward effect came from most types of foodstuff â most notably vegetables where there have been numerous recoveries of prices following sales and reports of cold weather in the UK impacting on crop production.</p>

                          <h3 class="">CPIH</h3>

                          <p>CPIH is a new measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers' housing costs (OOH). These are the costs associated with owning, maintaining and living in one's own home. CPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question âhow much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?â for an owner occupier. OOH currently accounts for just over 12% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This has increased gradually from a weight of 10% in 2005.</p>

                          <p>Currently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.</p>

                          <p>ONS currently classifies CPIH as an <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/news/assessment-and-designation-of-experimental-statistics.html">experimental statistic</a>. It is being assessed for National Statistics status by the assessment team of the UK Statistics Authority and is not currently a National Statistic. The assessment is expected to be completed by the summer of 2013. For further information on CPIH please see <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/introducing-the-new-cpih-measure-of-consumer-price-inflation/2005-to-2012/index.html">Introducing the new CPIH measure of Consumer Price Inflation, 2005 to 2012</a>.</p>

                          <p>In April 2013, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between April 2012 and April 2013) for CPIH grew by 2.2%, down from 2.6% in March.</p>

                          <p>The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in April 2013 was 0.2 percentage points, the same as in March. Owner occupiers' housing costs rose by 0.1% between March and April 2013, and also by 0.1% between March and April 2012. The 1-month movement was therefore the same in both years and this meant that OOH had no impact on the change in the overall CPIH 12-month rate between the two months.</p>

                          <p>Figure C below shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which CPIH inflation can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B below shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index numbers for the last year.

                          <p><strong>In accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the Retail Prices Index and its derivatives have been assessed against the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics. The <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/assessment-reports/assessment-report-246---the-retail-prices-index.pdf">full assessment report</a> can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.</strong></p>

                          <p>The RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions and rents and index-linked gilts. For further information on current and historic uses of the RPI please see <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/july-2011/how-ons-consumer-price-statistics-are-used.pdf">How ONS consumer price statistics are used</a>.</p>

                          <p>RPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The primary purpose of RPIJ is to enable users of the RPI to understand the impact the use of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) has on the RPI inflation rate.</p>

                          <p>ONS currently classifies RPIJ as an <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/news/assessment-and-designation-of-experimental-statistics.html">experimental statistic</a>. It is being assessed for National Statistics status by the assessment team of the UK Statistics Authority, but is not currently a National Statistic. The assessment is expected to be completed by the summer of 2013. For further information on RPIJ please see <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/introducing-the-new-rpij-measure-of-consumer-price-inflation/1997-to-2012/index.html">Introducing the new RPIJ measure of Consumer Price Inflation, 1997 to 2012</a>.</p>

                          <p>In April 2013, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between April 2012 and April 2013) for RPIJ grew by 2.3%, down from 2.7% in March 2013. The RPI 12-month rate for April grew by 2.9%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.</p>

                          <p>Figure D below shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last ten years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been on average 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 37.7% over this period, compared with 31.5% as measured by the RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 6.2 percentage points to the change in prices over the last ten years.

                              <p>On 16 May 2013, the UK Statistics Authority announced the launch of two reviews relating to price indices. The first review will consider what changes are needed to the range of consumer price statistics produced for the UK to best meet current and future needs. The second review will consider matters relating to the governance arrangements and structures supporting the production of consumer price statistics by ONS. For further details please see&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>Consumer price inflation for May 2012 to May 2013 will be published on 18 June 2013.</p>

                              <p>On 30 May 2013 ONS will publish the Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP) for the first time. This is an experimental series that measures the changes in price charged for renting private housing. The series will include a price index for Great Britain, its constituent countries and for the English regions. The production of this series is possible due to recent improvements in the housing components of the consumer price indices. Although the same data sources are used by both, the methodology of the IPHRP has been developed in order to produce region level series.<br /></p>

                              <p><strong>CPIH and RPIJ measures of consumer price inflation and the de-designation of RPI as a national statistic</strong></p>

                              <p>Two new measures of consumer price inflation, CPIH and RPIJ, were introduced with the February 2013 dataset published on 19 March.</p>

                              <p>ONS currently classifies both CPIH and RPIJ as <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/news/assessment-and-designation-of-experimental-statistics.html">experimental statistics</a>. They are being assessed for National Statistics status by the assessment team of the UK Statistics Authority and are not currently National Statistics. The assessment is expected to be completed by the summer of 2013. For further information on the measures see <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/introducing-the-new-cpih-measure-of-consumer-price-inflation/2005-to-2012/index.html">Introducing the new CPIH measure of Consumer Price Inflation, 2005 to 2012</a> and <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/introducing-the-new-rpij-measure-of-consumer-price-inflation/1997-to-2012/index.html">Introducing the new RPIJ measure of Consumer Price Inflation, 1997 to 2012</a>.</p>

                              <p>In developing her recommendations for RPIJ, the National Statistician noted that there is significant value to users in maintaining the continuity of the existing RPI's long time series, without any major change, so that it may continue to be used for long-term indexation and for index-linked gilts and bonds in line with user expectations. The UK Statistics Authority accepted this recommendation.</p>

                              <p>In accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the Retail Prices Index and its derivatives have been assessed against the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics. The <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/assessment-reports/assessment-report-246---the-retail-prices-index.pdf">full assessment report</a> can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.</p>

                              <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>

                              <p>The CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of almost 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 150 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for one year at a time.</p>

                              <p>The selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2013 basket are described in an article <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-and-rpi-2013-basket-of-goods-and-services.pdf" title="CPI and RPI 2013 Basket of Goods and Services"><span>Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index: the 2013 Basket of Goods and Services (354.4 Kb Pdf)</span></a> . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2013 are available from the National Statistics website in an article published on 26 April 2013 entitled <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/index.html">Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index: Updating Weights for 2013</a>.</p>

                              <p>Rates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices, which are rounded to one decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI are available on request. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.</p>

                              <p><strong>Revisions Policy</strong></p>

                              <p>CPI indices are revisable although the only time the CPI all items index has been revised was when the index was re-referenced to 2005=100, which took place with the publication of the January 2006 indices.</p>

                              <p>ONS currently classifies both CPIH and RPIJ as <a href="http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/news/assessment-and-designation-of-experimental-statistics.html">experimental statistics</a>. They currently follow revisions practices for CPI and RPI and specific policies have yet to be developed.<br /></p>

                              <p>Once the RPI indices are published they are never revised.<br /></p>

                              <p>The CPI's coverage of goods and services was extended in stages in the areas of health, education, childcare and insurance, with effect from the January 2000, 2001 and 2002 indices. In 2000, there was also a change to the population basis for the weights which was broadened from private households to include expenditure by foreign visitors and residents of institutional households. Further details can be found in a series of articles in the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html">CPI methodology section</a> of the Office for National Statistics website.</p>

                              <p>The official CPI series starts in 1996 but estimates for earlier periods are available back to 1988. These estimates are broadly consistent with data from 1996 but should be treated with some caution. <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/elmr/economic-trends--discontinued-/no--541--december-1998/harmonised-index-of-consumer-prices--historical-estimates.pdf" title="Harmonised index of consumer prices: historical estimates"><span>Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices: Historical Estimates (106 Kb Pdf)</span></a> provides more detail.</p>

                              <p>The CPIH's coverage of goods and services is currently the same as the CPI's, with the addition of a measure of owner occupiers' housing costs. A historical backseries is available back to 2005. Further details can be found in <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/introducing-the-new-cpih-measure-of-consumer-price-inflation/2005-to-2012/index.html">Introducing the new CPIH measure of Consumer Price Inflation, 2005 to 2012</a>.</p>

                              <p>RPI data are available back to 1947 but have been re-referenced on several occasions since then, generally accompanied by changes to the coverage and/or structure of the detailed sub-components.

                              <p>To further help users, very detailed CPI data are now available including the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-item-indices-and-price-quotes/index.html">individual price quotes and item indices</a> that underpin the CPI. Please note the data published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to December 2012. These data are updated once a quarter with around a two month lag with the latest CPI publication.

                              <p>Internationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU Member States. Eurostat released figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of April 2013 for EU Member States, together with an EU average, on 16 May 2013. A summary of the latest European data is available from <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teicp000&amp;tableSelection=1&amp;plugin=1">Eurostat's database tables</a>.
